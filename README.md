The topics covered in this assessment are as follows:
*  Github Pages
*  JupyterLite
*  Computation
*  Fourier-Transform
*  Quantum Computing

## Part 1: Github Pages

A static site hosting service offered by GitHub is called GitHub Pages. It enables you to use GitHub as the hosting platform to freely host a static website or web application online. You can host a personal blog, a project documentation website, or a collection of your work using GitHub Pages.

You must first build a repository on GitHub and submit the files for your website or web application there in order to use GitHub Pages. Your website or web application will then be created by GitHub Pages, published, and made accessible online at a URL that GitHub provides.

The static site generators Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby, as well as simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, are all supported by GitHub Pages. You can create your website or web application using any of these tools, then host it on GitHub Pages.[1]

* To use GitHub Pages you create a repository and enable Pages in the repository settings.

* You can specify a repository branch to be your website.

* Or you can use GitHub Actions, more below.

* Most commonly, a static site generator like Jekyll or Hugo is used.

* It is a bit unusual to use a branch for something totally different.

### Hugo

Go-based Hugo is a well-known open-source static site generator. It may be used to create a variety of websites, including blogs, project documentation, and e-commerce sites. It is quick and simple to use. Hugo converts source text written in a number of formats, including as Markdown and AsciiDoc, into static HTML pages by using templates written in the Go HTML template language. Support for custom content types, taxonomies, and shortcodes, as well as the capability to create a site with a single command, are some of the capabilities of Hugo.[2]

## Part 2: JupyterLite

A web-based variation of the open-source Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lite enables you to create and share documents with live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Jupyter Lite may be accessed from any device with a web browser and is made to be compact and simple to use.[3]

Jupyter Lite has a number of features, such as:

* Over 40 programming languages are supported, including Ruby, Python, R, and Julia.

* The capacity to run code and immediately see the results.

* Visualization and inline graphing of data.

* Support for formatting and adding supplementary material using LaTeX and Markdown.

* Elements that facilitate collaboration, like the capacity to share and work on notebooks with others.

## Part 3: Computation

Using a computer or another device to carry out calculations or solve problems is referred to as computation. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and involves processing data using algorithms and data structures.

Numerous issues, including mathematical calculations, data analysis, simulations, and machine learning tasks, can be resolved via computation. It is a crucial element in many branches of science, engineering, and commerce, and it is employed in data analysis, forecasting, and decision-making.

For computing, a variety of tools and languages are utilized, including data analysis software like R and Excel as well as programming languages like C, Python, and Java. The precise problem you're seeking to address and the resources you have at your disposal will determine the tool you should utilize.[4]

In this Part we discuss a little bit about Growth Rates, Big O Notation and Turing Machine. I also cover the experiments that challeneg Turing's Theory such as

* Double Slit Experiment[5]

* Stern Gerlach[6]

Then we take a look at Classical circuits,
Electronic circuits created specifically to carry out classical calculation are known as classical circuits. Boolean logic, which is founded on the ideas of classical physics, is used to manipulate data in what is known as classical computation.

Many different electronic gadgets, such as computers, phones, and other consumer electronics, utilise classical circuits. Transistors, semiconductor devices that can be used to regulate the flow of electricity via a circuit, are often the building blocks of these devices. It is possible to implement logic gates, which are the fundamental components of traditional circuits, using transistors.

Data processing, communication, and control are just a few of the many functions that traditional circuits are utilized for. They are employed in a wide range of disciplines, such as physics, electrical engineering, and computer science.[7]

## Part 4: Fourier-Transform

A mathematical method called the Fourier transform is used to break down a function or signal into its component frequencies. It is an effective technique utilized in many different disciplines, including as physics, engineering, and computer science.

The Fourier transform may translate a function or signal from the time domain to the frequency domain and vice versa. This is only one of its many useful qualities. The frequencies that make up a signal are separated from one another in the frequency domain, making it frequently simpler to study and modify them.

The continuous Fourier transform is used to transform functions that are specified over a continuous range of values, and the discrete Fourier transform is used to change sequences of discrete data points. These are the two basic types of Fourier transforms.[8]

We also take an in-depth look at some

* Complex Numbers

* Plots of Parabolas

* Quadtraic Formula's

* Fourier Transform

* Inverse Fourier Transform

* And much more[9]

## Part 5: Quantum Computing
![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*CQPNQqE4X2Jh5XomWQrWQQ.png)

A sort of computing known as quantum computing is based on the ideas of quantum mechanics, a physics theory that explains how matter and energy behave at the atomic and subatomic scales. Quantum computers manipulate data using quantum-mechanical phenomena like superposition and entanglement.

Due to the special characteristics of quantum mechanics, quantum computers have the ability to solve some types of problems much quicker than classical computers. For instance, whereas parallel computations can be done with conventional computers, they are not conceivable with quantum computers. Since they can factor large numbers and explore huge databases, they are particularly well-suited for specific jobs.

The technology of quantum computers is still in its infancy, and they are not yet extensively used. However, they have the potential to transform a variety of industries, including as pharmaceuticals, materials research, and encryption.[4]

In this Part we cover a large range of topics such as 

* Flipping a Coin

* Quantum Gates

* Deutsch Algorithm

* Oracles[10]
